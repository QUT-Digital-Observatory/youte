In short, an Application Programming Interface or API is a set of communication protocols that help two programs or applications talk to each other. According to this protocol, you send a request to the API, and the API returns a response code to tell you whether your request was valid, and a response body that contains the data requested.\nAs an API, YouTube Data API allows you to get the information for a wide range of resources. A YouTube resource is an entity that makes up the YouTube experience, including video, channel, playlist, comment, and search results. Each resource has a unique ID given by YouTube. These IDs will come in handy when you query data from YouTube API.\nThe API also allows you to update, delete or create YouTube resources, although as a data collection tool, youte currently does not support these operations.\n\n\nCommand-line\nWe mentioned that youte is a command-line tool. So what is a command line? A command line, or the shell, is an interface that takes textual, keyboard commands and passes them to your computer for execution.\nA variety of shells are used across operating systems. Some common ones are listed below:\n\nWindows: Command Prompt (cmd), Powershell, Git Bash\nLinux & Mac OS: Bash, Zsh\n\nApart from the very basic, We do not go in-depth on shell commands and how to use the shell in this tutorial.

Spacing is important in shell commands. Therefore, if there is any space in your search term, wrap everything inside quotes.\nThe results of this command will be printed to the terminal. You’ll observe that the results are very difficult to see.\n\nThis is because YouTube API returns data as a bunch of JSON, the standard format for data exchange between systems or applications. While the JSON contains a lot of useful information, in this format it is impossible to analyse and interpret.\nInstead, we can store the JSON in a file, to easily process it later using JSON-processing tools.\n$ youte search \"salmon recipes\" salmon_recipes_search.json\nBy specify the name of the file (“salmon_recipes_search.json”) at the end of the command, you instruct youte to store the results in that file, rather than print them out on the shell. The file has to have a .json ending.\n\nSearch options\nNow, that search is pretty broad. What if you only want videos uploaded within a specific period? The --from and --to options let you specify the time videos are published. Let’s specify that we only want salmon recipes videos uploaded within the last month.\nNote that shell commands have to be typed in one line. The backlashes (\\) are used to enter a new line without breaking the command and help with readability.\n$ youte search \"salmon recipes\" salmon_recipes_search.json \\\n    --from 2023-01-01 \\\n    --to 2023-01-31\nThe date has to be in YYYY-MM-DD format, otherwise you will get an error.\nLet’s refine our search a bit further.

To get a full list of available options, specify the flag --help.\n$ youte search --help\nThe --help flag shows the documentation for a command, so that’s usually the first place to go to if you want to know how to use a command.\n\n\nSave search progress\nOften there is a limit to how much data you get from YouTube API per day. Searching, in particular, is very “expensive” in terms of API usage. Therefore, you can choose to save the progress of a search so that if you exit the program prematurely, either by accident or on purpose, you can resume the search to avoid wasting valuable quota units.\nSpecifically, when you exit the program in the middle of a search, a prompt will ask if you want to save its progress. If yes, progress of the search is saved in a database, whose name is displayed in the shell along with instructions on how to resume progress from this database.\n\nTo resume progress from a database, add the --resume flag followed by the name of the progress file.\n$ youte search \"salmon recipes\" salmon_recipes_search.json \\\n    --from 2023-01-01 \\\n    --to 2023-01-31 \\\n    --video-duration short \\\n    --resume search_1675381044\nThe progress file is automatically deleted once youte has completed collecting all data for a search.\n\n\nExport to CSV\nAnother useful feature in youte is processing your results into a tidy CSV. To do so, specify the tag --to-csv followed by the name of the CSV file.\n$ youte search \"salmon recipes\" salmon_recipes_search.json \\\n    --from 2023-01-01 \\\n    --to 2023-01-31 \\\n    --video-duration short \\\n    --resume search_1675381044 \\\n    --to-csv salmon_recipes_search.csv\nNow you have the raw JSON file, as well as a tidy CSV file which can then be easily plugged into analysis software."

    "text": "Retrieve data about videos or channels\n\nVideos\nNow, if you look at the search results returned from youte search, you’ll see that they contain only a few fields of information. For example, video statistics are not provided, and video descriptions are truncated.\nyoute search only returns some data. Thus, if you want to get full data on a set of videos or channels you will need to use hydrate. Hydrating is a concept taken from Twitter API, which means retrieving the data about videos or channels using their IDs.\nyoute hydrate command takes as input a list of video or channel IDs and retrieves information on those. Each YouTube resource (video, channel, comment) is assigned a unique identifier. You can get the ID of a video in the URL or within the data returned by YouTube Data API. For example, the ID of a YouTube video can be found in the video’s URL:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MXTcO1veRQ\nNow let’s hydrate this video. By default, youte hydrate takes the IDs as video IDs and return video information. So you can hydrate one video easily with:\n$ youte hydrate 5MXTcO1veRQ\nYou can also hydrate multiple videos and store results in a file:\n$ youte hydrate 5MXTcO1veRQ cbAj3biUeDI dTI3I9ZFzTI videos.json\nIf you have a long list of IDs, you can put them all in text file, each ID on a new line, and instruct youte hydrate to use that file by specifying the -f flag.\n$ youte hydrate -f video_ids.txt videos.json\n\n\nChannels\nIf you want to hydrate a list of channel IDs, pass the --channel flag.\nHydrate 1 channel ID:\n$ youte hydrate --channel UC3mORGO2XYSn3Y_BUPuazeQ\nHydrate multiple channel IDs:\n$ youte hydrate --channel UCC-jcZTFL1r17E-bEC7VYYA UC3mORGO2XYSn3Y_BUPuazeQ\n\nWorking with channel IDs\nSimilar to video IDs, channel IDs can be found in the channels’ URLs (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3mORGO2XYSn3Y_BUPuazeQ).\nHowever, most often channel IDs will be more difficult to find because YouTube channels can have custom names and URLs (e.g. https://www.youtube.com/c/AmbitionMusic), or older channels might have a different URL (e.g. https://www.youtube.com/user/QueenAnime141). These custom names won’t be able to hydrate.\nTherefore, the best way to get channel IDs is in the search results from youte search.\n\n\n\nExtract IDs from youte data\nMore often, you want to do a youte search of relevant videos, then retrieve the full data on those videos, instead of copying and pasting video IDs from the URLs. youte dehydrate provides a quick way to extract the IDs from the JSON resulted by youte search, and store them in a text file.\nSay you have done a youte search for “salmon recipes” and stored the JSON result in salmon_recipes_search.json. Let’s get the IDs of all videos within that data, and store it in a file salmon_ids.csv.\nyoute dehydrate salmon_recipes_search.json --output salmon_ids.csv\nNow you can use hydrate -f to retrieve the full data for those videos.\nyoute hydrate -f salmon_ids.csv salmon_videos.json"

The major difference is that you have to specify a flag to indicate whether IDs belong to videos or threads.\nIf the IDs are video IDs, pass the -v flag to indicate so.\n$ youte get-comments -v 5MXTcO1veRQ cbAj3biUeDI dTI3I9ZFzTI\nOne potential issue you might run into when running this command is if the video has comments disabled. In this case, the program will show a warning and skip to other IDs if there is any.\nYou can get the replies to a thread by running get-comments with the thread ID and passing -t to indicate the ID belongs to a thread, not a video.\nIn a browser, the thread ID can be seen if you hover your mouse over a comment’s timestamp. Or you can get the thread IDs from the data returned by get-comments.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-mO7rbYtgk&lc=UgwTqVJTgz1gZl6X57Z4AaABAg\n$ youte get-comments -t UgwTqVJTgz1gZl6X57Z4AaABAg\nThis command will return an empty JSON if there are no replies."

    "section": "Tidy data into a relational database",
    "text": "Tidy data into a relational database\n\nJSON format\nAll data returned from youte search, youte hydrate, and youte get-comments are in JSON format.\nWhat is JSON?\nJSON is the most common way for exchanging text data. Today it is the universal standard of data exchange because of its conciseness, versatility, and platform independence.\nHere is an example of a JSON object.\n{\n  \"kind\": \"youtube#searchResult\",\n  \"etag\": \"B_TxCObncAju-vhnFwKefxRoNRI\",\n  \"id\": {\n    \"kind\": \"youtube#video\",\n    \"videoId\": \"SR2Mf27YweM\"\n  },\n  \"snippet\": {\n    \"publishedAt\": \"2022-08-31T00:43:25Z\",\n    \"channelId\": \"UCnSc_XzYmAMMSJX4shj7ovw\",\n    \"title\": \"30/08/22 :: 9 HOURS STUDY WITH ME [PART-2/2] :: CA: UPSC: PCS: IIT: NEET: SSC: OTHER EXAMS\",\n    \"description\": \"Why is this channel ? As we know that to get good marks in any exam ,we have to study hard and for which consistency is ...\",\n    \"thumbnails\": {\n      \"default\": {\n        \"url\": \"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SR2Mf27YweM/default.jpg\",\n        \"width\": 120,\n        \"height\": 90\n      },\n      \"medium\": {\n        \"url\": \"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SR2Mf27YweM/mqdefault.jpg\",\n        \"width\": 320,\n        \"height\": 180\n      },\n      \"high\": {\n        \"url\": \"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SR2Mf27YweM/hqdefault.jpg\",\n        \"width\": 480,\n        \"height\": 360\n      }\n    },\n    \"channelTitle\": \"BE CONSISTENT\",\n    \"liveBroadcastContent\": \"none\",\n    \"publishTime\": \"2022-08-31T00:43:25Z\"\n  }\n}\nEverything inside a curly braces belongs to an object. An object is basically a thing or an entity. Within that object, you can have object properties or attributes, represented by key-value pairs. As shown in the example above, you can also have objects nested within objects.\nAs you can see, the JSON format is great for data exchange, but not for data analysis, for which you’ll probably need something closer to a table or spreadsheet. This is where youte tidy might come in handy, as it processes and transforms raw JSON files into a relational, SQLite database.\n\n\nRelational database\nA relational database contains tables of columns and rows. Each row represents an entity (object) and each column an attribute of that entity. So it looks very similar to your spreadsheet or CSV file. While you can export YouTube data to CSV format using --to-csv in most youte commands, there are cases where a relational database is more desirable. Relational databases are excellent in checking data redundancy and joining data. For example, you can have a videos table, a channels table, a comments table and combine them in multiple ways to get a fuller picture of the dataset.\nSQLite is a light-weight database engine that stores an entire database within a .db file, making it easy to transfer and work with small-scale databases. Interacting with databases requires SQL, although there are tools and libraries that will minimise the amount of SQL you’ll need to read data.\nNow, let’s see what youte tidy does. It takes in a single JSON file as input, and a .db file as output.\nyoute tidy <INPUT-JSON> <OUTPUT-DB>\nThe JSON file should contain one type of resource (e.g. search result, video, channel, comment). And the output file must have a .db ending.\nyoute tidy salmon_videos.json salmon.db\n\n\nWorking with databases in R and Python\n\nR\nThere are many tools to work with SQlite files, in R and Python. In R, the RSQLite package offers a nice and easy way to interact and read data from .db files.\nlibrary(DBI)     # for createing database connection\nlibrary(RSQLite)\n\ncon <- DBI::dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), \"salmon.db\")\ndbListTables(con)             # list all tables in the database\ndata <- dbReadTable(con, \"videos\")  # get table `comments` to a dataframe\n\n\nPython\nThe pandas library offers some nice functions to connect with and read data from databases. pandas’ read_sql_query lets you query a database into a DataFrame.\nimport pandas\nimport sqlite3   # for creating connection with SQLite databases\n\n# connect to cleaned.db\ncon = sqlite3.connect(\"salmon.db\")\n\n# read all data from table \"comments\" to a pandas DataFrame\ndata = pandas.read_sql_query(\"SELECT * FROM comments\", con=con)"

Therefore, you can choose to save the progress of a search so that if you exit the program prematurely, either by accident or on purpose, you can resume the search to avoid wasting valuable quota units.\nSpecifically, when you exit the program in the middle of a search, a prompt will ask if you want to save its progress. If yes, progress of the search is saved in a database, whose name is displayed in the shell along with instructions on how to resume progress from this database.\n\nTo resume progress from a database, add the --resume flag followed by the name of the progress file.\n$ youte search \"salmon recipes\" salmon_recipes_search.json \\\n    --from 2023-01-01 \\\n    --to 2023-01-31 \\\n    --video-duration short \\\n    --resume search_1675381044\nThe progress file is automatically deleted once youte has completed collecting all data for a search.\n\n\nExport to CSV\nAnother useful feature in youte is processing your results into a tidy CSV. To do so, specify the tag --to-csv followed by the name of the CSV file.\n$ youte search \"salmon recipes\" salmon_recipes_search.json \\\n    --from 2023-01-01 \\\n    --to 2023-01-31 \\\n    --video-duration short \\\n    --resume search_1675381044 \\\n    --to-csv salmon_recipes_search.csv\nNow you have the raw JSON file, as well as a tidy CSV file which can then be easily plugged into analysis software."

    "text": "Retrieve data about videos or channels\n\nVideos\nNow, if you look at the search results returned from youte search, you’ll see that they contain only a few fields of information. For example, video statistics are not provided, and video descriptions are truncated.\nyoute search only returns some data. Thus, if you want to get full data on a set of videos or channels you will need to use hydrate. Hydrating is a concept taken from Twitter API, which means retrieving the data about videos or channels using their IDs.\nyoute hydrate command takes as input a list of video or channel IDs and retrieves information on those. Each YouTube resource (video, channel, comment) is assigned a unique identifier. You can get the ID of a video in the URL or within the data returned by YouTube Data API. For example, the ID of a YouTube video can be found in the video’s URL:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MXTcO1veRQ\nNow let’s hydrate this video. By default, youte hydrate takes the IDs as video IDs and return video information. So you can hydrate one video easily with:\n$ youte hydrate 5MXTcO1veRQ\nYou can also hydrate multiple videos and store results in a file:\n$ youte hydrate 5MXTcO1veRQ cbAj3biUeDI dTI3I9ZFzTI videos.json\nIf you have a long list of IDs, you can put them all in text file, each ID on a new line, and instruct youte hydrate to use that file by specifying the -f flag.\n$ youte hydrate -f video_ids.txt videos.json\n\n\nChannels\nIf you want to hydrate a list of channel IDs, pass the --channel flag.\nHydrate 1 channel ID:\n$ youte hydrate --channel UC3mORGO2XYSn3Y_BUPuazeQ\nHydrate multiple channel IDs:\n$ youte hydrate --channel UCC-jcZTFL1r17E-bEC7VYYA UC3mORGO2XYSn3Y_BUPuazeQ\n\nWorking with channel IDs\nSimilar to video IDs, channel IDs can be found in the channels’ URLs (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3mORGO2XYSn3Y_BUPuazeQ).\nHowever, most often channel IDs will be more difficult to find because YouTube channels can have custom names and URLs (e.g. https://www.youtube.com/c/AmbitionMusic), or older channels might have a different URL (e.g. https://www.youtube.com/user/QueenAnime141). These custom names won’t be able to hydrate.\nTherefore, the best way to get channel IDs is in the search results from youte search.\n\n\n\nExtract IDs from youte data\nMore often, you want to do a youte search of relevant videos, then retrieve the full data on those videos, instead of copying and pasting video IDs from the URLs. youte dehydrate provides a quick way to extract the IDs from the JSON resulted by youte search, and store them in a text file.\nSay you have done a youte search for “salmon recipes” and stored the JSON result in salmon_recipes_search.json. Let’s get the IDs of all videos within that data, and store it in a file salmon_ids.csv.\nyoute dehydrate salmon_recipes_search.json --output salmon_ids.csv\nNow you can use hydrate -f to retrieve the full data for those videos.\nyoute hydrate -f salmon_ids.csv salmon_videos.json"

    "text": "Get comments\nIf you’re interested in the conversation going in the comment section, youte get-comments retrieves the comment threads (top level comments) under a video or a list of videos. youte get-comments can also retrieve replies to those comment threads using the thread IDs.\nget-comments works similarly to hydrate in that it takes one or many video IDs or thread IDs, which can be input straight to the shell, or stored in a text file and referred to with the -f flag. The major difference is that you have to specify a flag to indicate whether IDs belong to videos or threads.\nIf the IDs are video IDs, pass the -v flag to indicate so.\n$ youte get-comments -v 5MXTcO1veRQ cbAj3biUeDI dTI3I9ZFzTI\nOne potential issue you might run into when running this command is if the video has comments disabled. In this case, the program will show a warning and skip to other IDs if there is any.\nYou can get the replies to a thread by running get-comments with the thread ID and passing -t to indicate the ID belongs to a thread, not a video.\nIn a browser, the thread ID can be seen if you hover your mouse over a comment’s timestamp. Or you can get the thread IDs from the data returned by get-comments.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-mO7rbYtgk&lc=UgwTqVJTgz1gZl6X57Z4AaABAg\n$ youte get-comments -t UgwTqVJTgz1gZl6X57Z4AaABAg\nThis command will return an empty JSON if there are no replies."

    "section": "Tidy data into a relational database",
    "text": "Tidy data into a relational database\n\nJSON format\nAll data returned from youte search, youte hydrate, and youte get-comments are in JSON format.\nWhat is JSON?\nJSON is the most common way for exchanging text data. Today it is the universal standard of data exchange because of its conciseness, versatility, and platform independence.\nHere is an example of a JSON object.\n{\n  \"kind\": \"youtube#searchResult\",\n  \"etag\": \"B_TxCObncAju-vhnFwKefxRoNRI\",\n  \"id\": {\n    \"kind\": \"youtube#video\",\n    \"videoId\": \"SR2Mf27YweM\"\n  },\n  \"snippet\": {\n    \"publishedAt\": \"2022-08-31T00:43:25Z\",\n    \"channelId\": \"UCnSc_XzYmAMMSJX4shj7ovw\",\n    \"title\": \"30/08/22 :: 9 HOURS STUDY WITH ME [PART-2/2] :: CA: UPSC: PCS: IIT: NEET: SSC: OTHER EXAMS\",\n    \"description\": \"Why is this channel ? As we know that to get good marks in any exam ,we have to study hard and for which consistency is ...\",\n    \"thumbnails\": {\n      \"default\": {\n        \"url\": \"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SR2Mf27YweM/default.jpg\",\n        \"width\": 120,\n        \"height\": 90\n      },\n      \"medium\": {\n        \"url\": \"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SR2Mf27YweM/mqdefault.jpg\",\n        \"width\": 320,\n        \"height\": 180\n      },\n      \"high\": {\n        \"url\": \"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SR2Mf27YweM/hqdefault.jpg\",\n        \"width\": 480,\n        \"height\": 360\n      }\n    },\n    \"channelTitle\": \"BE CONSISTENT\",\n    \"liveBroadcastContent\": \"none\",\n    \"publishTime\": \"2022-08-31T00:43:25Z\"\n  }\n}\nEverything inside a curly braces belongs to an object. An object is basically a thing or an entity. Within that object, you can have object properties or attributes, represented by key-value pairs. As shown in the example above, you can also have objects nested within objects.\nAs you can see, the JSON format is great for data exchange, but not for data analysis, for which you’ll probably need something closer to a table or spreadsheet. This is where youte tidy might come in handy, as it processes and transforms raw JSON files into a relational, SQLite database.\n\n\nRelational database\nA relational database contains tables of columns and rows. Each row represents an entity (object) and each column an attribute of that entity. So it looks very similar to your spreadsheet or CSV file. While you can export YouTube data to CSV format using --to-csv in most youte commands, there are cases where a relational database is more desirable. Relational databases are excellent in checking data redundancy and joining data. For example, you can have a videos table, a channels table, a comments table and combine them in multiple ways to get a fuller picture of the dataset.\nSQLite is a light-weight database engine that stores an entire database within a .db file, making it easy to transfer and work with small-scale databases. Interacting with databases requires SQL, although there are tools and libraries that will minimise the amount of SQL you’ll need to read data.\nNow, let’s see what youte tidy does. It takes in a single JSON file as input, and a .db file as output.\nyoute tidy <INPUT-JSON> <OUTPUT-DB>\nThe JSON file should contain one type of resource (e.g. search result, video, channel, comment). And the output file must have a .db ending.\nyoute tidy salmon_videos.json salmon.db\n\n\nWorking with databases in R and Python\n\nR\nThere are many tools to work with SQlite files, in R and Python. In R, the RSQLite package offers a nice and easy way to interact and read data from .db files.\nlibrary(DBI)     # for createing database connection\nlibrary(RSQLite)\n\ncon <- DBI::dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), \"salmon.db\")\ndbListTables(con)             # list all tables in the database\ndata <- dbReadTable(con, \"videos\")  # get table `comments` to a dataframe\n\n\nPython\nThe pandas library offers some nice functions to connect with and read data from databases. pandas’ read_sql_query lets you query a database into a DataFrame.\nimport pandas\nimport sqlite3   # for creating connection with SQLite databases\n\n# connect to cleaned.db\ncon = sqlite3.connect(\"salmon.db\")\n\n# read all data from table \"comments\" to a pandas DataFrame\ndata = pandas.read_sql_query(\"SELECT * FROM comments\", con=con)"
